# Breakout board for D14-363GY/123 CRT

This is a simple breakout board that includes impedance
matching networks (in this case tunes for 202 MHz - note
that this lies outside the specs for this tube) for deflection
plates and routes the high voltage and filament currents
to a DB9 connector. This PCB will be used as a mounting
structure for the CRT in a specific application (that
has nothing to do with running an oscilloscope or
visualizing signals)

The (inofficial) symbol and footprint used for the
D14-363GY/123 CRT pin layout is available in an
extra [KiCAD library](https://github.com/tspspi/tspikicadlibs)
